Thanks for taking the time to complete this frontend technical assessment. We will be focusing on software quality (scalability, readability, maintainability, etc.) and your eye for detail. You may include any libraries, but Vue.js is preferred and jQuery is not recommended. Along with following best practices, bonus points for following our [coding guidelines](https://github.com/mindarc/frontend-assessment/wiki/Coding-guidelines). 

##### Exercise 1

I have used bootstap for the layout and grid, HTML & CSS as per the requirement.

##### Exercise 2

###### Bonus points

The expression 'b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a' will be evaluated a (regular concatenation) s:

As ('b') + ('a') will display = ba
+ (+'a') = Display NaN (Not a Number)
+ ('a') = a
The current result will be: baNaNa
From this expression toLowerCase() method is applied that will result to banana
