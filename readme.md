###### Bonus points
---
The expression 'b' + 'a' + + 'a' + 'a' will be evaluated a (regular concatenation) s:

As ('b') + ('a') will display = ba
+ (+'a') = Display NaN (Not a Number)
+ ('a') = a
The current result will be: baNaNa
From this expression toLowerCase() method is applied that will result to banana
